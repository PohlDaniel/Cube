# Cube

This repository contains a new setup of https://sourceforge.net/projects/cube/files/cube/2005_08_29.
I added the needed SDL and zLib dependencies and also wrote a small description how to build it on windows.
By my own I used Visual Studio 2015.

It should be clear that the Copyright of Cube and of all dependencies not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
